# ECE528 KL Algorithm

This project was done as part of ECE528 VLSI CAD-I(Physical design Automation) Coarse.
KL algorithm is an iterative improvement algorithm for bi-partitioning a netlist.


## Steps to clone and execute the program.
You can use the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/Keerthan1994/KL-Algorithm.git

cd  /KL-Algorithm/KL Algorithm

python3 KLfinal.py

You would require version python 3 or above
